# You will need to build two models for this homework
# - one using Naive Bayes and one using Logistic Regression.
# Both of your models should do the same task of classifying reviews into either “positive” or “negative” based on chosen features.
# Then based on the definition of “fake”, you can do additional analysis to flag any reviews that could be “fake”.
